This is a simple front-end clone of the Spotify interface that I built using HTML and Tailwind CSS. I created it to practice layout design and learn more about responsive web design using utility classes

What I Used:-
HTML for the structure of the page

Tailwind CSS for styling everything without writing custom CSS

Google Fonts to use the 'Poppins' font

Font Awesome to add icons

What I Did:-
I started by creating the basic layout using flex and flex-col to stack things vertically

I used md:flex-row so the layout changes on medium and larger screens

I added a sidebar that shows on desktop using hidden md:flex, and I made a bottom navbar for mobile using fixed and bottom-0

For colors, I chose dark shades using classes like bg-black, bg-zinc-900, and text-white to match Spotify’s theme

I added spacing using padding and margin classes like p-2, mt-4, and ml-2

I used rounded corners with rounded-md and rounded-full for a sleek look kinda

I used hover: effects to add interactivity on teh webiste like changing colors or making icons scale up, you can find that by hovering on most of the buttons and banners

I added responsive behavior by using Tailwind’s md: prefix, so the layout changes depending on screen size, it still has some flaws here and there but i tried out most of it
